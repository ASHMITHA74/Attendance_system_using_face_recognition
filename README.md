# Attendance_system_using_face_recognition
The Attendance System using Face Recognition is an innovative project designed to automate the attendance tracking process. I have made this project using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
The system works by capturing images of individuals' faces through a camera or webcam. The system compares their faces with the templates stored in its database. It quickly matches the captured face with the existing records to identify the person, mark their attendance, and store it in the form of an Excel sheet.

The modules you need to import are:
Opencv,
Face_recognition,
Dlib,
Cmake,
Numpy,
Date and time,
os.

You can import the above by using:
pip install modulename

I have done this project in Jupyter Notebook. 
Face_matching.ipynb This file tells about how much of a percentage two photos can be matched.
Attendance_proj.ipynb This file actually works by identifying faces through the webcam and comparing them with the faces stored in the database and displaying your name and storing your name and time in an Excel sheet.
The library we used for matching faces is face-recognition which works by Histogram of gradients (HOG).
